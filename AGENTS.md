# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This document defines guidelines for AI agents, assistants, or automated tools interacting with the project repository.

It ensures consistency when generating code, modifying components, or extending the system.

---

## Agent Responsibilities

Agents may assist with:

- generating code
- improving model performance
- implementing new features
- refactoring modules
- writing documentation

Agents must not:

- modify core model assumptions without documentation
- introduce breaking architecture changes
- alter dataset schema silently

---

## Project Principles

1. Deterministic pipelines
2. Reproducible experiments
3. Modular architecture
4. Clear data lineage

---

## Coding Standards

Language:

Python

Style guide:

PEP8

Preferred libraries:

pandas  
numpy  
scikit-learn  
xgboost  
scipy  

---

## Development Rules

Agents should:

- preserve folder structure
- document new modules
- keep functions small and modular
- include docstrings
- avoid unnecessary dependencies

---

## Architecture Boundaries

Agents must respect module boundaries:

data → ingestion only  
features → feature generation  
models → training and inference  
probability → statistical calculations  
betting → odds comparison logic

---

## Model Constraints

Model assumptions must remain:

- count data prediction
- poisson objective
- two-model architecture
- rolling averages

Changes to these assumptions require documentation updates.

---

## Documentation Policy

Every major change must update:

PROJECT_CONTEXT.md  
ARCHITECTURE.md  
PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md

---

## Agent Safety

Agents must never:

- place real bets
- connect to bookmaker accounts
- perform automated wagering

The system is strictly an **analytics tool**.
